# Tip-Tab-Till
I have extensive experience managing challenging puzzle situations in the Tip-Tab-Till system. The task involves navigating a penguin figure through grid cells to turn the entire board white, requiring strategic planning, problem-solving, and pattern recognition skills. By playing the Penguin Puzzle Game, one can showcase proficiency in solving complex riddles and utilizing both manual and algorithmic puzzle-solving techniques. Additionally, there are four types of algorithms available to solve the game, namely DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*, which can be programmed using C++.
